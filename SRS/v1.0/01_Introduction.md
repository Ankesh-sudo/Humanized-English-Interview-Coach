# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
---
## 1.1 Purpose of the Document
---

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a complete and detailed description of the requirements for the system titled Humanized Professional English Communication & Interview Coach.

The purpose of this document is to:

Define the functional and non-functional requirements of the system

Act as a reference for developers, designers, testers, and reviewers

Serve as a long-term evolving blueprint for future versions

Support academic evaluation, internships, and real-world deployment

This SRS is designed to be highly scalable and may expand to hundreds or thousands of pages as advanced features, AI behaviors, and interview analytics are added.

## 1.2 Intended Audience
---

This document is intended for the following audiences:

Student Developers – for implementation guidance

AI/ML Engineers – for conversational behavior modeling

Language Trainers & Interview Coaches – for pedagogy alignment

Project Reviewers & Evaluators – for assessment and validation

Future Contributors (GitHub) – for collaboration and extension

No prior knowledge of advanced AI systems is mandatory to understand the core sections of this document.

## 1.3 Product Overview
---

The Humanized Professional English Communication & Interview Coach is an AI-driven system designed to simulate a patient, human-like English mentor.

The system helps users to:

Improve spoken English fluency

Correct grammar and sentence structure

Learn professional office communication

Practice mock interviews (voice / video / text)

Receive post-session feedback and improvement plans

Build confidence through non-judgmental interaction

Unlike traditional chatbots, the system strictly follows human mentoring behavior rules, prioritizing natural conversation first, correction second.

## 1.4 Scope of the Product
---

The scope of this system includes:

Included Features

Spoken English practice (voice & text)

Sentence replay and correction mechanism

Professional English transformation

Office communication mode

Interview simulation mode

Post-interview performance analysis

Adaptive difficulty based on user progress

Confidence-building conversational flow

Excluded Features

Medical or psychological diagnosis

Therapy or counseling services

Real-time emotion detection

Unauthorized data collection

Any form of user manipulation or coercion

The system is educational and professional, not clinical.

## 1.6 Problem Statement
---

Many English learners face the following challenges:

Fear of speaking due to mistakes

Lack of real conversational practice

Over-correction that reduces confidence

Absence of personalized interview training

Difficulty transitioning from casual to professional English

Existing tools focus on grammar accuracy, but fail to behave like a patient human mentor.

This project aims to bridge that gap.

## 1.7 Proposed Solution
---

The proposed system provides:

A humanized AI coach that responds naturally first

Structured correction without interruption

Mode-based behavior (practice, office, interview)

Replay-based learning for clarity

Post-interview analytical feedback

Progressive learning based on user patterns

The system adapts over time while maintaining strict ethical and behavioral boundaries.

## 1.8 Operating Environment
---

The system is intended to operate in the following environments:

Web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

Desktop and mobile platforms

Microphone-enabled devices

Camera-enabled devices (for video interviews)

Backend services may utilize:

AI/NLP engines

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules

Secure cloud infrastructure

## 1.9 Design and Implementation Constraints
---

The system must never interrupt the user

Grammar correction is not allowed during live interviews

Replay is restricted by mode

No sensitive personal data collection

Human-like tone must be preserved at all times

The system must not act as a therapist or doctor


## 1.10 Assumptions and Dependencies
---
Assumptions

Users have basic English understanding

Users consent to conversational practice

Internet connectivity is available

Dependencies

Secure session handling

Frontend audio/video support


## 1.11 Document Evolution
---

This SRS is a living document.

Future versions may include:

AI confidence scoring

Interview analytics dashboards

Skill progression visualization

Multilingual support

Enterprise HR integration

Each update will be versioned and tracked on GitHub.
